##👋 Hi, I'm Nathan Morris

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a Computer Science Student currently interested in AI and Machine Learning, CyberSecurity, and Information Technology. I am currently working on a Full Stack Website that uses Python and FastAPI. I am interested on working on projects that are designed to help people's lives and are practical.

### 🚀 What I Do:
- **Machine Learning Researcher**: Exploring **drug-target affinity prediction** using **BERT embeddings** and neural networks.
- **Software Developer**: Building **efficient algorithms and system-level applications** in **C++ and Python**.
- **Cybersecurity Enthusiast**: Practicing ethical hacking, penetration testing, and exploring security vulnerabilities.

## 📂 Featured Projects
🔬 **Enhancing Drug-Target Interaction (DTI) Prediction through Combined BERT Embeddings**  
- Utilizes **ChemBERTa** and **DNABERT** for feature extraction.  
- Implements a **neural network regression model** in **PyTorch**.  
- Focuses on optimizing **binding affinity prediction (Ki values)**.

🧠 **Comparative Analysis of Traditional ML and Neural Networks in Multi-Class Classification**  
- A Machine Learning project comparing **SVMs vs. Neural Networks**.  
- Uses datasets like **Wine Quality**, **Iris**, and **Million Song Dataset**.  
- Evaluates models based on **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.

🔧 **Pagetrace Memory Management Simulator**  
- Implements **multi-level page tables** using **bitwise operations**.  
- Simulates **memory address translation** and **page access tracking**.  
- Developed in **C++ with POSIX threading**.
